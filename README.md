### Wokwi Simulation
Wokwi Project:

[![Wokwi Project]](https://wokwi.com/projects/448775611106394113)

**Project Description:** The Lockheed Martin Flight Simulator aims to assist pilots in training for upcoming missions. With the ability to simulate what will be seen in actual flight, the simulator is useful for anyone looking to gain experience in the area of flight. The system involves an active status indicator, throttle, throttle check, and emergency system. Pilots can enhance their ability to maintain stable engine control, while also get used to all the safety mechanisms in place during an actual flight. The real-time nature of the system allows users to get used to the crucial timing factors seen when actually in flight, which could lead to danger if not respected.
